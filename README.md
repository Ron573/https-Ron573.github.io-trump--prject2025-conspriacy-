## Overview  

This repository contains an article and supporting documentation analyzing whether a **criminal conspiracy charge** could be brought against Donald Trump and the enablers of Project 2025 in connection with the January 6th insurrection.  

The work is written in the first person, integrating **legal precedent**, **systems science analysis**, and **open-source intelligence (OSINT)**. It is not a legal brief prepared by an attorney, but a structured memorandum intended to advance public understanding of systemic risks to constitutional governance.

## Purpose  

This repository exists as both:  
1. **A resistance document**: exposing systemic failures in feedback loops of law, courts, and governance.  
2. **An academic contribution**: linking information theory, systems science, and law into a framework of accountability.

⚖️ **Bottom Line**: If conspiracy law does not apply here, then it applies nowhere.
